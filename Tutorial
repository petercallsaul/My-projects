r# U Matter Tutorial – How to Use the App

This Website was made by me and my mate Mazen Ragab and he is the one who has changed the website name from U Matter to Pyle

---

## 1) Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or newer: https://nodejs.org/en/download
- A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- Optional: Supabase project for auth/realtime features

---

## 2) Get the Code
If you already have the folder, skip this. Otherwise:
```powershell
# example
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
```
Project root is the `Pyle-main` folder.
Enter powershell and write C:\Users\SPEED\Downloads\Umatter\Pyle-main
---

## 3) Install Dependencies
From the `Pyle-main` directory:
```powershell
npm ci
```
If `npm ci` fails, use:
```powershell
npm install
```

---

## 4) Run in Development
From `Pyle-main`:
```powershell
npm run dev
```
Open: http://localhost:8080

Vite’s dev server will print a Local URL and possibly Network URLs. Use the Local URL.

---

## 5) Using the App (Demo Mode)
The UI works out of the box. For a quick demo, use these default credentials:

- Administrator
  - Email: `admin@pyle.com`
  - Password: `SecurePass123!`
- Psychologist
  - Email: `dr.smith@pyle.com`
  - Password: `TherapySecure456!`
- Patient
  - Email: `patient@pyle.com`
  - Password: `Anonymous789!`

Note: In full integrations, authentication is provided by Supabase. Without configuring Supabase (see Section 6), some features may be mocked or limited.

---

## 6) Optional: Configure Supabase
If you want authentication, realtime, and database-backed features:

1. Create a Supabase project: https://supabase.com/
2. Get your values from Project Settings → API
   - URL
   - anon (public) key
3. Create a `.env` file in `Pyle-main` with:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-project-url>
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
```
4. Restart the dev server:
```powershell
npm run dev
```

Environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to the frontend via Vite.

---

## 7) App Tour
- Login: Choose a role and sign in using demo credentials or your Supabase-backed auth.
- Dashboard: Navigate between Patient, Psychologist, and Admin views depending on your role.
- Chat: Explore secure chat UI. With Supabase configured, you can wire this to realtime features.
- Booking: Try the session booking flow.
- Theme: Toggle dark/light mode from the top navigation.

---

## 8) Build for Production
Create an optimized build:
```powershell
npm run build
```
Preview the production build locally:
```powershell
npm run preview
```
This serves the built site and prints a local URL to open in your browser.

---

## 9) Deploying
You can host the production `dist/` output on static hosts like Vercel or Netlify.
- Vercel (example):
  - Install the Vercel CLI and run:
    ```powershell
    vercel --prod
    ```
- Netlify:
  - Set build command to `npm run build` and publish directory to `dist`.

Make sure to configure environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_*`) in your hosting provider if you use Supabase.

---

## 10) Troubleshooting
- Port already in use (8080):
  - Close conflicting app or change port in `vite.config.ts` under `server.port`.
- Node version issues:
  - Ensure `node -v` shows v18+.
- Dependency install issues:
  - Run `npm cache verify` and try `npm ci` again.
  - If needed, delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install`.
- Browserslist warning:
  - Optional to update: `npx update-browserslist-db@latest`
- Env variables not applied:
  - Confirm `.env` is in `Pyle-main` and names start with `VITE_`.
  - Restart `npm run dev` after changes.

---

## 11) Tech Stack Reference
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- Supabase (Auth, Database, Realtime)

---

## 12) Quick Commands Reference
```powershell
# install deps
npm ci

# start dev server
npm run dev

# production build
npm run build

# preview production build
npm run preview
```

---

That’s it! You should now be able to install, run, explore, and optionally configure the Pyle app with Supabase.
